# 🎮 My Game Hub

A simple and elegant **Game Hub** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Currently includes two classic mini-games:

- **⭕ Tic Tac Toe** → Two players take turns placing **X** or **O**. Get three of your symbol in a **row, column, or diagonal** to win.  
- **🐍 Snake Game** → Control the snake to eat food and grow longer. Don’t hit the walls or yourself!
